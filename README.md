# Pseudocode Scraping App

This is a basic application that queries the Wikipedia API for a specific page's HTML for the user and scrapes all pseudocode segments with a simple regex, displaying them one at a time (depending on which one the user is searching for).

I wanted to learn Vanilla Javascript and DOM Manipulation thoroughly through practice and so, no frameworks or libraries are used in the frontend side. The backend uses Express and is hosted on Now by Zeit.
