# Pseudocode Fetching App

Find it here: <https://locrian24.github.io/pseudocode/>

This is a basic application that queries the Wikipedia API for a specific page given by the user and extracts all pseudocode segments, displaying them one at a time (depending on which one the user is searching for).

I wanted to learn Vanilla Javascript and DOM Manipulation more thoroughly and so not frameworks or libraries are used in the frontend side, with the backend being powered by Express.js
